A powershell code that allows you to convert all html files in a selected folder.

I did it to properly convert notes from anotepad.com

When you run the exe file, the powershell console will appear, followed by a file selection dialog box. You need to select the file, or the folder it is in, then click “OK” and the conversion will start. It doesn't take long, so you'll see the number of processed files on the command line and the question “Do you want to open the folder with converted files? (Y/N):” you need to type y or n as you wish (Y means Yes, N means No) and press Enter
